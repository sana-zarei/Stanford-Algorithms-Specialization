**Instructor**: [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768)

## Introduction
This repository contains the problem set and programming assignment solutions in C++ to the specialization. On Coursera, the specialization consists of four courses.

Date Started: 6 February 2021

Date Completed: 14 April 2021

The problem set and programming assignment solutions are uploaded only for reference purposes. Please attempt the quizzes and programming assignments yourself and only look at the explanations if you find that you still can't understand it after consulting the discussion forums and reviewing the lecture content.
